## Project Description
Edupox is a knowledge-sharing social network. The goal of Edupox is to spread and expand knowledge around the world. Not all information can be recorded in writing, but a lot of it still isn't. It is either kept in people's minds or is only available to you if you know the appropriate individuals. To better understand one another, we want to bring individuals with diverse viewpoints together, link those who have information with those who need it and provide everyone with the tools they need to share their knowledge with the rest of the world. 

Users of the site may post questions, which anyone can then answer. It enables users to vote on answers to highlight the most accurate information possible. It focuses on high-quality questions and answers.  

Users can also share their thoughts, new ideas, and findings and explain complex concepts through posts. It allows users to create social circles and connect with like-minded people. They can follow topics that interest them and advance their knowledge.  

Users can filter their search of posts, questions & answers by choosing their categories of interest. 

Every piece of content on the site is generated by users, meaning it is created, edited, and organized by the same people that use the website.
